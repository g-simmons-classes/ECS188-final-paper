For the final paper for this class, you will write a 5,000-6,000 word argumentative essay on a technology ethics topic of your choice.

## Guidelines:
- Your essay must have a thesis. One way to get to a thesis is to form and answer a guiding question, or a set of guiding questions.
- Your essay should use external resources (other articles, essays, primary research, editorials, media, ...) to support your thesis.
- The thesis must have something to do with a technology, and it must have something to do with ethics.

## Templates for guiding questions/thesis

The list that follows is a list of example statements or questions that could be used to form your thesis.

- What are the most important ethical considerations related to technology X? Argue why some ethical considerations are most relevant.
- An ethical consideration that has been downplayed for technology X is actually relevant.
- When is the use of technology X ethical? When not?
- Why is the use of a particular technology in a particular area ethical or unethical?
- Trends in use of technology X indicate that it is being used more or less ethically over time.
- It is/is not possible to use technology X ethically.
- Some group (Americans, Californians, young/old people, humans in general) have some responsibility to use or not use a particular technology.
- Of the set of technological options for addressing some social problem, technology X is the least/most ethically objectionable.

## Tips

- Read a lot. You may find it hard to come up with a thesis you feel is worth arguing for. This problem tends to solve itself the more you read in your topic area.
- Choose a scope that is narrower than you think you need. You may respond "what if I don't have enough content to fill ten pages?". In my experience, students tend to choose topics that are too broad, and end up with an impossible tradeoff between breadth and depth in the final paper.
- *How* you make your point is of first-class importance. I am not concerned with you coming to any particular conclusion in your paper. I am more concerned with the structure of your argument, the evidence you select, etc. Note that this does not mean the argument has to follow today's normative ethics. You may, for example, argue that technology plays a role in distorting today's normative ethics, making them unsuitable for use.
- Imagine a reader and how they might respond to your paper. Writing is a form of communication between two parties. Argumentative writing has the goal of updating how your reader thinks about the world. The reader enters your paper with some preconceived notions about reality, you should imagine what these might be and write accordingly. Imagine a reader who is charitable, in the sense that they want to come to a "better" view of the world, and will give your paper an opportunity to change their mind. At the same time, the reader is skeptical, and will not change their mind without sufficient evidence or argumentation.
